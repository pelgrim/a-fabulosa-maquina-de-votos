# A Fabulosa Maquina de Votos
## The fabulous voting machine

"a fabulosa maquina de votos" is a 8051 assembly software for a simple (and non-programable) voting machine.

It was written in a short short time frame, so it's mostly creepy code you should keep away. Still, it has its good and funny moments, so maybe you can have a good time reading it, although it must be very hard for non-portuguese headers to understand.

As it is now on a git repository, it's very likely it you get some polishing, and maybe soon I will update this readme saying it is good code and you should worship me. Maybe.
